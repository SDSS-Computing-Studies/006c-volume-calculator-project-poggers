def title
    The title welcomes the user to the program.
    It shows the creators of the volume program.


def instructions
    In our instructions, it lists the four steps to for the calculator.
    It also asks whether the user would like to continue straight to the calculator.
    If the user is unsure, it will ask to replay the instructions.
    Once everything is sorted out, it will bring you to the calculator.

def getParams
    Figures out which shape the user wants to calculate.
    It asks the user which shape from the list they want to calculate and takes their response and outputs
    one of the lists with instructions and an identifying number at the start.

def getInputs
    Uses the fist number in the return string from getParams to decide how many inputs are needed then aks for those inputs 
    as well as setting an identifier for the calc function. If the parameters are invalid it recoiseze that and dosen't ask for any inputs

def calc
    uses the Indentifier and numbers from get inputs to calculate the volume. 

def main
    Main calls for the title function and instructions function. 
    After that it calls to return getParams into getInputs into calc. 
    It then prints the answer and asks the user if they want to continue. 
    If they do want to continue it will send them back to pick a shape, otherwise it will end the program.
